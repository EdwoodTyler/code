<h1>About</h1>

<p>Code was designed and developed by me - Tim Green - aged 16. It was initally thought of after trying to learn programming myself and wasting months, if not years learning the wrong languages, the wrong way.</p>

<p>Whether you want to build an interective database-driven website, a blog or just a simple website we will guide you down the exact path you need to excel. Not only that but we will only teach you the things you need to know. There's no "here's how to draw a blue square on a webpage", it's just the useful, required skills you need to get started.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>
