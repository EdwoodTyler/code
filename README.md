# Code

Code is a project aimed at teaching people the usefull skills needed when coding. Other websites such as Codecademy teach the fundamentals of programming (variables, conditions, syntax etc.) and at a stretch will show how to draw a red circle on a webpage. That is where Code (work in progress title) comes in. Code will teach people the useful skills needed to actually make something to be proud of; through a combination of tutorials, interactive lessons and homework tasks.
